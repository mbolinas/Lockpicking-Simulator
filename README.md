# Lockpicking-Simulator
A simulator for lockpicking


what we still need to do:
	add graphics for background lock
	add graphics for pin chamber
		there will be a line, or division of some sort in the pin chamber so the user knows where the pin is supposed to set
			this line goes away when hard mode is toggled on
	add graphics for pin itself
	add sounds
		sound plays when pin hits bottom
		sound plays when pin crosses chamber line
		sound plays when pin gets set
		sound plays when user moves lockpick
	add graphics, sounds, etc for 'you win!'
	add ability to randomize
	add ability to reset
	add hard mode functionality
	some slight repositioning so the lockpick is 'aligned' with the pin chambers properly
